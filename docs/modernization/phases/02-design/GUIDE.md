# Design Phase Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY CONSTRAINT
**NO SOURCE CODE MODIFICATIONS ALLOWED**

During the design phase, **absolutely NO modifications** to source application files are permitted:
- Reference source code for design decisions ONLY
- Create all design artifacts in `project-artifacts/02-design/` ONLY
- Source application must remain unchanged and protected
- Any file creation must be in the artifacts directory, never in source code

## Overview
This phase focuses on designing the target application architecture and modernization approach.

## Objectives
- Define target architecture
- Plan migration strategy
- Design new components and interfaces
- Create transformation roadmap
- Establish validation criteria

## Activities
1. Target architecture definition
2. Migration strategy planning
3. Component design
4. Roadmap creation
5. Acceptance criteria establishment

## Deliverables
- Target architecture specification
- Migration plan
- Component design documents
- Acceptance criteria
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Output Location
All design artifacts should be placed in `project-artifacts/02-design/`
